# Hi there, I'm Cyra!
I'm a recent graduate of the Mission Ready advanced software developer course, where I learned more about software engineering and developed hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I don't have any professional experience yet, I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and continuing to learn and grow as a developer.

## Skills

## Projects
Here is the latest project I've worked on recently:
